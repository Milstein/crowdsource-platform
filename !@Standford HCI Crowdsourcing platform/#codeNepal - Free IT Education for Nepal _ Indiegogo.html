<h2><b>Success stories from Bangladesh</b></h2>
<p>We currently have 500+ students enrolled in Dhaka, Bangladesh in just 1 year of local operations.</p>

<p>We have an amazing team of 25 people (of which 23 are locals) running the local CT.</p>
<p>After only two months of education, our students already earn $150/200 a month, with no prior IT experience. &nbsp;The best case is of a student who landed a $10.000 project with an international client just two months into our education!!</p>
